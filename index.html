            <p>My name is Anthony Kim. I am a 27 year old male currently working in the dental field. I studied biology and
                medical anthropology during my undergraduate studies at the University of California in Irvine. Upon graduation,
                I studied emergency medicine and got my EMT-B certificate. Upon learning that transporting patients to hospitals
                was not my passion, I began working as a dental assistant and studied for the dental admissions exam. Although
                my scores were not bad, this again was not my passion. Although my heart was in healthcare, I found that
                I was continuously drawn to technology even within medicine and dentistry. I began noticing that there were
                a lot of inadequacies in the digital space around healthcare. I began looking into websites, apps, and programs
                in dentistry and medicine and found that it was an area that, in my opinion, could use improvement. I'm hoping
                to utilize my volunteer and work experience in healthcare with the skills I can learn through this program
                to bring at least a little bit of improvement.</p>
